# Project 1 - Rasterizer

In this project, we implemented rasterization techniques, including drawing triangles, supersampling, transforms, interpolation with Barycentric coordinates, and texture mapping with antialiasing (pixel and level sampling). With this, we obtained a functional vector graphics rendered for simplified SVG files.

From a high-level perspective, the pipeline includes an `SVGParser` that reads the SVG files, an OpenGL `Viewer` that renders the images and tracks keyboard and mouse inputs, and a `DrawRend` class with methods to coordinate the drawing of `SVGElement` objects. These last objects would call the appropriate methods of a `Rasterizer` class, where most of the coding of this project focused on.
