## Project Summary
Since the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in 2019, the pandemic has become one of the biggest concerns for the people around the world.
In order to better understanding and visualizing the transmission of COVID-19, in this project, we will be implementing a realistic 3D Covid-19 particle and airflow simulations based on physics modeling.
Furthermore, we aim to simulate how masks/shields can prevent the particles/droplets from spreading out and evaluate our simulations on realistic scenes (e.g., closed space, airplanes).

## Problem Description
COVID-19 disease have posed unprecedented challenges to the entire world. Up to April 2022, around 500 million people were reported to be infected. In order to better understanding and visualizing the transmission of COVID-19, in this project, we will be implementing a realistic 3D COVID-19 particle and airflow simulation based on physics modeling.

It's well understood that COVID-19 is transmitted mainly through close contact and respiratory droplets. Therefore, we aim to investigate how the virus spreads through particles and droplets. We will use the realistic data and parameters (droplet size, ariflow speed, etc.) for our simulations. Specifically, our goals can be summarized as follows:
1) Simulating the transmission of particles/droplets during the phases of inhalation and exhalation using fluid dynamics.
2) Simulating how masks/shields can prevent the particles/droplets from spreading out during the phases of inhalation and exhalation.
3) Simulating and evaluating the COVID particle transmission in realistic scenes (e.g., closed space, airplane with/without active air circulation).
